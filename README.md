# Magnetic-Field-Simulator
This project simulates sensor readings based on the distance, orientation and shape of the magnets.

## Requirements
OpenGL

## Usage
Create a magnet and sensor obects. The move() and rotate() methods can be used to manipulate the magnets in 3D. To measure the magnetic field from a magnet use the measureBFromMagnet() method and give a magnet object as a parameter.

## Coming soon
Visualizer
More magnet shapes
